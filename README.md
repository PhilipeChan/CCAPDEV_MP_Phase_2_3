Complete Web Application for Food Reviews Philippines!

This is a web application for food enthusiasts to post their opinions on the different types of food they have
tasted in the Philippines. One should first create an account to be able to access the web application's features, such as 
creating a post, commenting on others' posts, upvoting/downvoting others' posts and comments, utilizing the search bar to find specific posts, and more!

To set up the web application locally, one must simply change the directory to this folder in the command prompt, enter "node index.js", and go to http://localhost:3000 in your selected browser (Chrome is recommended).

Backend code is based on Sir Arren Matthew C. Antioquia's CCAPDEV tutorial repositories in https://github.com/arvention?tab=repositories, which includes ccapdev-mongoose, ccapdev-ajax, ccapdev-validation, ccapdev-hashing, ccapdev-session, and ccapdev-2021t2-mc03.
